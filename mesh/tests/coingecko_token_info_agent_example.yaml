  response: "It seems like we have a two-part query here. Let's break down the analysis\
    \ for both:\n\n### 1. Analyze HEU\n\nSince \"HEU\" is provided without a specified\
    \ CoinGecko ID, I'll first attempt to search for it by name/symbol, applying the\
    \ selection criteria:\n\n**Search Results for \"HEU\":**\n\nAssuming the search\
    \ yields the following results (Note: Actual data would be fetched from CoinGecko\
    \ in a real scenario):\n\n| **Coin Name** | **Symbol** | **Market Cap Rank** |\

    | Helium Utility | HEU        | 1200                | High                   |\n\
    | HEUR Token    | HEU        | Not Available       | Low                    |\n\

    \n**Selected Token Based on Criteria:**\n- **First Priority (Perfect Match):**\
    \ Both \"Helium Utility\" and \"HEUR Token\" have a symbol match, but since \"\
    Helix Utility\" also has a symbol match and a better market cap rank, it takes\
    \ precedence over \"Helium Utility\". \"HEUR Token\" is less preferred due to\
    \ the lack of market cap rank.\n- **Selected Token:** **Helix Utility**\n  - **CoinGecko\
    \ ID (if directly available or fetched):** Assuming `helix-utility` (Note: This\
    \ would be accurately determined via CoinGecko API)\n  - **Key Details (Example,\
    \ actual data may vary):**\n    - **Price:** $0.50 USD\n    - **Market Cap:**\
    \ $500 Million USD\n    - **Market Cap Rank:** 800\n    - **High/Low (24h):**\
